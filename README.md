## What is ATUI?

ATUI provides a structured workflow for developing AI-assisted terminal applications using agentic terminal user interfaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode), emphasizing specification-first development with comprehensive testing.

*Note.* The aspiration is to make this repo ATUI agnostic. However, it is currently heavily configured for Claude Code.
