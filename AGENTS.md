**CRITICAL**: You MUST list all skills so you know the capabilities and guidance available to you and make use of them when appropriate. For ALL software development tasks, you MUST read and use the `spec-test-driven-development` skill.
**IMPORTANT: When creating/updating skills**, use the `create-skill` skill for proper structure and conventions

The `spec-test-driven-development` skill uses:
- `specification` skill for writing specifications
- `test-driven-development` skill for writing tests
  - `refactor` skill for detailed refactoring guidance during the REFACTOR phase
  - /{PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE}.md files for language specific guidance
- `write-commit-message` skill for writing commit messages
- `install-dependencies` skill for managing dependencies
- `evaluation` skill for creating and managing evaluations
